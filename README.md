🧠 Intelligent Medical Image Analysis & Report Generation


A Deep Learning-Based Decision Support System for Brain MRI Image Classification and Clinical Report Generation

📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on intelligent analysis of Brain MRI images using advanced Data Mining and Machine Learning (DMML) techniques. It builds a complete pipeline from data preprocessing to model deployment, incorporating explainability tools, visualizations, and decision support modules.

The core objectives are:

Accurate classification of brain conditions from MRI scans.

Model transparency using explainability techniques like SHAP and Grad-CAM.

Clinical decision support through automated rule-based reporting.

🧭 Project Phases
